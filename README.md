# NewsAPPStage1
Udacity Android Basics course project 6 News App stage 1. Learning to connect to an API and show the results of the query in the app.

I ended up making a huge mess and not knowing how to recover from it. Still need to learn how to use versions. 
Anyway ended up starting again and uploading the file as a new project.
